### Discord
ExectOS has a Discord Server to socialize, get support, support others, learn, contribute, collaborate, and stay up to
date on all things related to XTOS and Open Source. This is also a place where you can meet ExectOS Developers. Everyone
is welcome to [Join our Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/zBzJ5qMGX7).

### Why Discord?
Discord is a VoIP instant messaging and digital distribution platform. It
 * is broadly accessible,
 * is popular with non-technical people,
 * broadens the appeal of XTOS beyond traditional spaces and audiences,
 * allows for communication over voice, video, and text.

### Guidelines & Rules
 1. Treat everyone with respect. Absolutely no harassment, witch hunting, sexism, racism, or hate speech will be tolerated.
 2. No age-restricted or obscene content. This includes text, images, or links featuring nudity, sex, hard violence, or
    other graphically disturbing content.
 3. No spam or self-promotion (server invites, advertisements, etc) without permission from a staff member. This includes
    DMing fellow members.
 4. Do not share real media depicting gore, excessive violence, or animal harm, especially with the intention to harass
    or shock others.
 5. Do not share content that violates anyone's intellectual property or other rights.
 6. Do not distribute or provide access to content involving the hacking, cracking, or distribution of stolen goods,
    pirated content, or accounts.
