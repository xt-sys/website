This project includes content and code that has been partially created or assisted by artificial intelligence (AI) tools.

### Tools We Use
We actively use the following AI tools to support development and documentation workflows:
 * **ChatGPT**: for generating and reviewing code, technical writing, and problem-solving assistance.
 * **Gemini Assistant**: integrated with VS Code, used for code suggestions and refactoring.
 * **Windsurf**: VS Code extension that helps streamline repetitive coding tasks.
We are also experimenting with other AI-based tools to evaluate their usefulness in different areas of the project.

### Human Review
All AI-assisted contributions are reviewed and validated by human developers before being committed to the project. We ensure
that any code, documentation, or design produced with AI meets our quality and security standards.

### Why Use AI?
Using AI tools allows us to:
 * Accelerate development and reduce boilerplate
 * Improve consistency in code and documentation
 * Explore alternative solutions more efficiently
 * Focus developer time on complex or creative tasks

### Transparency & Ethics
We are committed to transparent and responsible use of AI. Our goal is to ensure that AI supports - but never replaces -
thoughtful human contribution. If you have any questions or concerns about the role of AI in this project, please open an
issue or contact the maintainers.
