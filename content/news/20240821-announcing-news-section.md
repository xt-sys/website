We are excited to announce the launch of "News" section on this website! This idea was brought to life thanks to Aiken
Harris, who proposed it on our Discord server. The community gave it a warm reception, and as a community-driven project,
we made it happen. We always listen to your feedback and strive to meet your needs. The new 'News' page is a perfect
example of that.

The News page is designed to keep you updated on what's happening in the project. Every month, you'll find information
about our progress, any challenges we've encountered, and details about interesting events as well as other announcements.
It is a place where you can stay connected and informed about the project's journey.

We believe that keeping you informed and involved is key to our success. The News section is all about fostering a sense
of unity and collaboration, making sure you feel like an integral part of the project. Stay tuned for our monthly updates,
and join us in celebrating the milestones and achievements of our collective effort!

Do not forget to [join our Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/zBzJ5qMGX7) if you have not already! It is the best
place to share your ideas, give feedback, and connect with other community members. Your voice matters, and together,
we can make this project even better. See you there!
