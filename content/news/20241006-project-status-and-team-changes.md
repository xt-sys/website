As we continue to work on our open-source Operating System, we would like to take a moment to update you on the current
status of the project and some changes within the team.

Unfortunately, our lead developer, Rafal Kupiec, is currently unable to dedicate sufficient time to the project due to
personal and health-related reasons. I want to take this opportunity to wish Rafal all the best and a speedy recovery.
His absence has been noticed by the community, and we are all eagerly awaiting his return to active development. Given
Rafal's limited availability, he will be focusing on designing solutions and acting as an architect for the project. I
hope that this situation will change soon, and Rafal will be able to return to actively developing software.

To ensure the continued development of ExectOS, I (Aiken Harris) have been granted direct access to all repositories,
allowing me to actively contribute to the project. Thanks to Rafal, I have joined the team as a Core Developer. I will be
focusing on implementing Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP) in the near future.

I would also like to extend an invitation to anyone interested in joining our team and contributing to the ExectOS
development. If you are passionate about operating system development, please don't hesitate to reach us out and join our
community.

Once again, on behalf of the whole community, I wish Rafal all the best, good health, and perseverance during these
challenging times. I am confident that with the support of our community and the dedication of our team, ExectOS will
continue to thrive.
