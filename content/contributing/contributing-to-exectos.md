The ExectOS project and CodingWorkshop Team always seek new contributors from all skill levels. No matter if you are
a developer, tester, designer, or techwriter, your contributions are always appreciated.

### Software Developers
We are always looking for people proficient in C and/or Assembly, especially familiar with tools such as Bochs, Qemu,
or VirtualBox. Writing an Operating System is not a beginner's task. In fact, writing an Operating System is usually
considered the most difficult programming task. Join the exclusive ranks of people knowing OSDev concepts, and yet
smaller ranks of people knowing the secrets of NT&trade; architecture.

### Testers
No software is usable if it is found to be unstable. Writing an Operating System, is yet more complex task. Tester role
is responsible for assisting the development process by running [builds](/download) and providing a feedback. All and any
information about issues you encountered during this process can be
[reported](https://git.codingworkshop.eu.org/xt-sys/exectos/issues). The more detailed report is, the easier it will be
to fix it. At least basic knowledge in collecting information from a crash, like backtraces and knowledge of using
debugger will help you. When submitting issues, take care that the bug report is not a duplicate of an already existing,
open issue. You should always follow the template specified for issues in our Gitea.

### Technical Writers
As a team, we focus mostly on OS development. We are looking for some creative people to update and write documentation,
post content to this website as well as social media accounts to promote ExectOS. New web site design ideas and bug fixes
are as well welcome.

### Community Managers
The ExectOS community keeps in touch via [Discord](/contact-us). Community Manager role is responsible to keep people
involved, keep discussions going and moderate.
